I am from Reus, Spain. I graduated with a bachelor in Engineering Physics and Computer Science at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, and a master’s degree in Machine Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I joined Imperial College London in Oct 2021 as a PhD candidate in Computing and a teaching scholar. My research interests are mostly based on machine learning, more specifically causal discovery, representation learning, and sequential data modelling. Apart from doing research, I enjoy bouldering, playing padel, reading, and being around with close friends and family.
